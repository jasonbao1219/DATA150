In order to solve many emerging social and economic problems brought by the rapid economic development as well as the population increase in the past decades, many ideas and solutions are proposed, in which one of them is urban compact development. However, due to the difficulty of obtaining data as well as the “unclearness in the definition of urban functional compactness,” few reliable methods have been developed to address the problem of urban compactness measurement. But thanks to the “increasing availability of public source data” as well as the advancement of technologies such as POIs (points of interest), GIS (geographic information systems) and VIIRS(Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite), human activities and data can be better analyzed and understood. With these as prerequisites, in this paper the authors have developed the Functional Compactness Index(FCI) which seeks to “(1) it can distinguish the differences in the urban functional compactness among cities; (2) its computation procedure should be objective enough to ensure the soundness of its results; and (3) it should be suitable for large-scale research in term of input data availability.”

In the study, the authors use the data of POIs, VIIRS, RNO (Roads Network of OpenStreetMap) from four Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Xi’an and Xiamen to explore and analyze the difference in their urban compactness. FCI works by first “[taking] the street blocks in RNO data as the basic spatial analysis unit. Then, the FCI identifies the functional attributes of each street block according to the POIs. Finally, it uses NPP/VIIRS nighttime light data to determine the intensity of human activity in functional zones.”
POIs are used to determine the functionality of every basic street block units. They are “identified based on the proportion of each kind” out of six kinds and the belonging of a street block is determined by which functionality has the largest number of points. Meanwhile the intensity of human activity is based on the data from VIIRS. After analyzation, it concludes that “the degree of mixing between the residential zone and the other zones is greater, the average distance between the residential zone and other zones is shorter, and the urban function is more compact.” Moreover, higher human intensity means more compactness in the city. Generally, the intensity of human activities is highest near the city center, gradually decreases from center to the city limits, increases again at city sub-centers, then continues decreasing. 

In conclusion, the authors have proved that greater human intensity means more compact city functions; also, the mixing of residential zones with other zones is positive correlated with the compactness of a city. The authors also provide solutions to address the problems in the city. For example, “By shortening the average distance between residential zones and other zones, urban activity can be increased, and urban functional compactness can be improved.” The FCI can both reflect the overall compactness of a city as well as local compactness; for example, smaller cities like Xiamen and Xi’an have a bigger and more balanced FCI (8.59, 6.63) while bigger cities like Shanghai and Beijing have a smaller FCI (5.78, 4.69) but “FCI is high in the center of the city and low in the periphery.” It shows that in the smaller cities, the intensity of human activity is more balanced, and the overall functional compactness is optimal.

This paper is related to Sen’s definition of human development by examining and analyzing the data from urban areas to develop a new methodology to address the social and economic problems arise in the context of Urbanization. The goal of sustainable cities and communities is in relation to this article. The datasets of POIs, RNO, GIS and map resources are used. The authors try to measure the urban compactness in a comprehensive and detailed way in order to solve problems in urbanization.
